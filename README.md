Tank Sloshing Simulation with Thin Wall Baffles - OpenFOAM Tutorial

Topics:
1-Create STL file and boundary preparation using Fusion 360

2- Meshing using cartesianMesh with cfMesh

3-Create thin wall baffles using topoSet and createBafflesDict

4- Set boundary and run using interFoam solver

5- Create iso-volume and plot free surface elevation over time with ParaView
